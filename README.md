# Fraud-detection---Isolation-Forest
Fraud detection is a critical task in many industries, including finance, e-commerce, and healthcare. With the rise of digital transactions, the ability to accurately detect fraudulent transactions has become more important than ever before. One popular technique for fraud detection is the isolation forest algorithm.

Unlike traditional anomaly detection techniques that rely on distance-based metrics, such as Mahalanobis distance or Euclidean distance, the Isolation Forest algorithm uses a tree-based approach. It constructs a random forest of isolation trees, where each tree isolates data points by randomly selecting a feature and then splitting the data based on a random threshold value. The algorithm then identifies the data points that can be isolated with the fewest number of splits as potential anomalies.

In this project, we use the Isolation Forest algorithm to build a fraud detection system that can identify fraudulent transactions in a given dataset. We will explore various data preprocessing techniques and feature engineering methods to prepare the data for training the model. We will then train the Isolation Forest model on the prepared data and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as F1 score. Finally, we will discuss ways to optimize the model and fine-tune its hyperparameters to achieve better performance.
