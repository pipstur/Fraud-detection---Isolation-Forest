# Fraud-detection---Isolation-Forest
The Isolation Forest algorithm is a powerful unsupervised machine learning technique that can be used to detect anomalies in data, such as fraudulent transactions. In this project, we use Isolation Forest to build a fraud detection system and explore various data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques to optimize its performance.
